<ul>
<li>Choose parameters that help influence your experience of the Durak game. When done click Start. 
Clicking reset puts the values to their default values. Pressing exit closes the program.<br>

<li>you are the human player, and can only move your cards. There is one other computer player.</li> 
<li><i>The goal of the game is to get rid of all of the cards in your hand.</i> After playing your turn, the 
other player tries to beat the cards which you've set down.</li>
<li>Attacking and Defending Cards must be of the same suit or else a special trump suit that is 
determined at the beginning of the game. If the cards are the same suit, then the rank is used to determine 
which one is actually higher. Trump suits have higher precedence than rank or suit. Trumps are shown in the 
top right hand corner of the game's screen<br>

<li>At the beginning of the game, the deck size is setup with either 20, 36 or 52 cards. The number of 
cards remaining in the deck is shown in the top left hand corner of the game's screen<br>
<img src="cards-left.png"/></li>
<li>Players each receive a maximum of 6 cards from the deck, and continue to receive more cards at the 
beginning of each round, until the deck runs out of cards.</li>
<li><b>Attack:</b> The attacker may add cards to the table as long as they are the same rank as the others 
that they have already set down. The method to add cards is by clicking their card.</li>
<li><b>Defend:</b> The defender may add cards to the table after they have been attacked. The defender must 
match the same number of cards, and each card must beat each attacking card. If the defender loses, they 
must pick up all the cards from off the table and add them to their own hand.</li>
<li><b>Done:</b> At the end of the attack of defend operation, the player must click the done button.<br>

<li><b>Forfeit:</b> If the player wishes to, they may forfeit their turn, causing the opposing player's 
turn hand to be amalgamated with the player's</li>
</ul>
<h3>Scenario</h3>
<p>In the following scenario, the typical steps of a game are performed for illustration purposes</p>
<ol><li>When the game starts, they are dealt some cards. These cards are at the bottom of the screen<br>
<img src="mouse-over.PNG"/></li>
<li>After clicking the card, it goes into the table. Click done after you have chosen all your 
attacking cards. From there, the other player may see it, and will make their defense<br>

<li>When the defender plays his cards, some text is displayed on the page with information about which 
player has done what. The place where the attacker's cards are placed is always above the defender's cards.<br>
<img src="screen2.jpg"/></li>
<li>As you can see in the previous picture, the defender's card is placed underneath the attacker's card 
and is higher in rank then the attacker's card, so the defender wins the round, and gets to play first 
during the next round.</li>
<li>From time to time, there may be situations where you may not be able to beat another attacker's turn 
and desire to cede victory. Press the Forfeit button instead. For example, the computer player has set 
down a trump card, and our trump card does not have high enough rank to beat theirs, so you must forfeit.<br>
